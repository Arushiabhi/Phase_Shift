# Python code to calculate Phase shift using Refrence Potential Approach
How to Run Program.

This is the readme file for execution of Scattering Phase Shift Programs

Please follow these steps :

Step-1. Copy or write this code directly into Python Terminal/Spyder/Jupyter Notebook.
Step-2. Save it with extension .py
Step-3. Now execute this code window using function key 'F5' this automatically save and execute the program.

OR
Download Repository
Unzip it
Open .py file with spyder
Press Function key "F5" this automatically save and execute the program
A figure window with required plots is visible.

# to execute the program follow the steps:
step 1: uncomment the Energy and Phase shift data for l=0 state 
step 2: uncomment non-linear equation for l=0
step 3: uncomment potential parameters for l=0
step 4: Execute this code using function key 'F5'
follow same steps for l=2 state while commenting the l=0 state
